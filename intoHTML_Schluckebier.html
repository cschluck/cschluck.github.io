Hello! My name is Cindy Schluckebier. I am a business education teacher from Independence, Missouri. I facilitate learning at two student operated businesses on the square in Independence through the Independence School District. Juniors and seniors from the three high schools in the district come to our stores to learn about principled based entrepreneurship, finance, and innovation.  When I am not teaching I am busy starting my consulting business, K12 Perform, with my two other partners. I have zero web application or development training or experience so I am ready to learn all I can about HTML5 and CSS3 as I can absorb in the eight weeks we have together. My expectations for this course is to try something I know nothing about and succeed. I feel I often ask this of my students and I need to be vulnerable and try something new myself.  I hope to apply the skills I have learned in this course to help me turn the modules I have written for my business into online platforms. My hobbies right now center on my kids and the new house I just purchased. I love to garden and do anything my kids are involved in.  With the quarantine in place we are playing tons of board games and crafting.
