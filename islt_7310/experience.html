    <h4>Jan 1999-July 2009</h4>
    <h3>ENTREPRENEUR, CLATWORTHY’S</h3>
    <p>Clatworthy’s was a three generation family business in operation for over 70 years.
        I was primarily responsible for merchandising, purchasing, and customer service. I worked side by side with my dad until we closed the business in July 2009 due to his health issues. We were a team. I excelled at merchandising and marketing while he was fantastic at selling and customer service. I learned so many life lessons from being an entrepreneur. The one transferrable skill for education that I gained from entrepreneurship is the customer is the most important person in the room. As a teacher the student, parent, and community are now my customers.

        <h4>August 2005–June 2016</h4>
        <h3>BUSINESS TEACHER, NEW FRANKLIN R-1</h3>
        <p>During my time at New Franklin R-1 I began my career in education and wore many hats. I taught all business courses, was the FBLA sponsor, NHS sponsor, and Yearbook sponsor, and delivered professional development to teachers in grades K-12. At NF I became a certified eMINTS teacher and coach and hosted many other educators across the nation in my classroom showcasing the eMINTS model of instruction. The culture at NF led me to grow professionally and try new trends in education as I had administrative support. I learned failure in the classroom can lead to future success with the proper mindset. </p>
