    <main>
    <p>Since the fall of 2016 I have been a business teacher in the Independence School District. Currently, I facilitate learning at two student operated businesses with juniors and seniors through an entrepreneurship capstone course. <strong>Through this experience students embrace the entrepreneurial spirit through real businesses and gain key entrepreneurial skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, risk-taking, and teamwork</strong>. So far in my career this is my favorite position. It has taken all of my past experiences and passions and molded them together into one position. I have the opportunity here to use my past experience to help empower students of the ISD to be more entrepreneurial.</p>
