    <h3>Personal Reflection & Philosophy</h3>
    <p class="reflection">I believe children are amazing and unique individuals who are seeking a stable, safe environment to learn, grow, and prepare for their futures. One of the reasons I became a teacher, after being an entrepreneur for ten years, is I am a mom too. I saw the love I had for my daughter and I knew at one point in my life she would grow up and begin her life independently from mine. I didnâ€™t want to live my life without children present. That is the moment I decided to become a teacher. My philosophy of learning follows the eMINTS model. I hope to impact my students by providing high quality lesson design, inquiry based learning, establishing a sense of community, all supported by the use of technology.</p>
    <p class="philosophy">I am passionate about every child that walks through my classroom door. They are all special to me and I strive to teach them as much as possible. I absolutely love being a teacher and having the opportunity to work with young adults daily and to help prepare them for their futures. It is my hope that I might be making a difference in some of their lives. </p>

    <aside id="HQL">
    <h3>High Quality Lesson Design</h3>
    <p class="philosophy">I believe high quality lesson design leads to highly engaged students. When developing these lessons many of them fall under the headline of inquiry based learning.  Students are required to not only answer questions, but also come up with their own questions to content covered.  I believe students are engaged when they are given an authentic problem and have to try to solve the problem. They may not be able to completely solve it, but then I would have the chance to model a growth mindset for them of not giving up or learning from their mistakes. In this type of learning environment the teacher becomes more of a facilitator instead of the teacher. This style of learning makes the classroom culture come together where students and teacher work together and oftentimes the teacher even becomes the learner from their students.</p>
    </aside>
    <aside id="COL">
    <h3>Community of Learners</h3>
    <p class="philosophy">Working together and creating valuable relationships is essential to a successful, safe, positive classroom environment. I strive to create thses relationships daily. I enjoy when my students and parents feel welcome when they are in my classroom. By taking the time to do team building activities and changing groups from time to time builds this environment and makes for a strong classroom atmosphere. I display student work, even at the high school level. Many students take pride in their work and enjoy seeing their work showcased.</p>
    </aside>
    <aside id="Tech">  
    <h3>Use of Technology</h3>
    <p class="philosophy">When I think about technology I try to be adaptive to the learners in my classroom. I strive to stay updated on the current issues in education that will help them succeed and implement those changes and trends to my students. When writing high quality lessons and implementing inquiry based learning I oftentimes refer to the SAMR method and reflect on where the lesson is and if technology should even be used. If I am not using it effectively, then why use it? I strive to use technology in an effective manner, not just to use it because it is expected.</p>
